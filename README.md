## Installation
I struggled with the first installation for Tune-A-Video, so I wrote what I learned with a lot of details and explanations to help whoever wants to reproduce my results or use Tune-A-Video for other goals.
the detailed installation guideline can be found [here](https://github.com/shani1610/object-insertion-video-diffusion/blob/main/tuneavideo_installation.md). I also included the conda list results mentioning all the packages in the working environment and their versions, you can find it [here](https://github.com/shani1610/object-insertion-video-diffusion/blob/main/conda_list.md).
